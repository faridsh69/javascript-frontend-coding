# Solution Docs

+ We need a select with 2 input types:
+	1 array
	2 url - https://api.github.com/search/users?q={query}&per_page={numOfResults} 

This component cant use both array and url.
This component must be reusable.
First example should works fine as it is working fine.
Up/Down keys should works for select between options and enter should trigger onSelect.
After onSelect triggered that Item should replace in inoput.
onSelect should return user ID.

New APIs and your notes should be documented in SOLUTION.md.
